# Win/Loss Themes

<!--
PURPOSE: Track patterns in why you win and lose deals.
This informs everything: positioning, messaging, product, sales process.

THE WORKFLOW:
1. After each closed deal (won or lost), review transcripts
2. Identify why you won or why you lost
3. Document themes and patterns
4. Look for changes over time (are new objections appearing?)
5. Feed learnings back into positioning, ICP, and campaign messaging

WHY THIS MATTERS:
If you don't know why you're winning, you can't replicate it.
If you don't know why you're losing, you'll keep making the same mistakes.

HOW TO USE:
- Review monthly or quarterly
- Share with product team (build what helps you win)
- Update source/icp/positioning.md based on themes
- Use in campaign messaging to address common objections

## Win Themes

### Why We Win: Time to Value

**Pattern**: Prospects choose us because they can get up and running in hours, not weeks.

**Frequency**: Mentioned in 65% of won deal transcripts

**Evidence**:
- Account_023: "We evaluated 3 tools. You were the only one where we got value on day 1."
- Account_041: "Our eng team is lean. We can't spend 2 weeks onboarding a new tool."
- Account_067: "Tried it Friday afternoon, deployed to prod on Monday. That sold us."

**How to Amplify**:
- Lead messaging with "Live in 1 hour" vs. competitors' "2 week implementation"
- Offer guided onboarding calls for hesitant prospects
- Case studies showing fast time-to-value

### Why We Win: No DevOps Team Required

**Pattern**: Mid-market companies don't have dedicated SRE/DevOps, our self-service model fits.

**Frequency**: Mentioned in 55% of won deals

**Evidence**:
- Account_089: "We're 30 engineers. Can't dedicate someone to DevOps full-time."
- Account_102: "Need something that eng team can use without specialized knowledge."

**How to Amplify**:
- Position against "enterprise" tools that need dedicated teams
- Show case studies with lean eng teams (10-50 people)
- Free trial lets them prove it themselves

---

### Why We Win: Pricing Model Aligns with Usage

**Pattern**: Per-project pricing (not per-seat) resonates with how they think about cost.

**Frequency**: Mentioned in 40% of won deals

**Evidence**:
- Account_115: "Other tools charge per seat. With 50 engineers, that's $$$. Your model makes sense."
- Account_134: "We have 10 projects, not 100. Pay for what we use."

**How to Amplify**:
- Lead with pricing structure in discovery
- ROI calculator comparing seat-based vs. project-based

---

## Loss Themes

### Why We Lose: Building In-House

**Pattern**: Larger teams (>50 eng) decide to build internal tool instead.

**Frequency**: 30% of lost deals

**Evidence**:
- Account_156: "Our CTO wants to build this internally. We have the capacity."
- Account_178: "Decided to dedicate 2 engineers to building our own solution."

**When This Happens**:
- Larger companies (>500 employees)
- Strong internal tools culture
- Have bandwidth (not shipping fast)

**How to Counter**:
- Emphasize maintenance burden: "Who owns this in 2 years when those engineers leave?"
- Share stories of companies that regretted building in-house
- Position as "buy your way out of a distraction"

**Should We Fight This?**:
- If they're >1000 employees with dedicated platform team: Probably not our ICP
- If they're 50-200 employees: Yes, revisit in 6 months when maintenance hurts

---

### Why We Lose: "Too Expensive"

**Pattern**: Sticker shock, especially for companies coming from open source or free tiers.

**Frequency**: 20% of lost deals

**Evidence**:
- Account_189: "Love the product but can't justify $30K right now."
- Account_201: "We're using GitHub Actions for free. Hard to switch to paid tool."

**When This Happens**:
- SMB/early-stage (Seed, pre-revenue)
- Haven't had painful incident yet (cost is abstract)
- Economic buyer not engaged (champion can't get budget)

**How to Counter**:
- Get economic buyer involved early (don't spend time with championif they can't get budget)
- Frame cost vs. engineer time: "$30K = 150 hours of engineer time saved"
- Offer smaller starting package or pilot

**Should We Fight This?**:
- If they're <10 employees, <$1M revenue: Not our ICP, let them churn from free tier later
- If they're 50+ employees, >$5M revenue: Yes, it's objection handling not true price issue

---

### Why We Lose: Prefer Competitor X

**Pattern**: Already invested in competitor's ecosystem, hard to switch.

**Frequency**: 15% of lost deals

**Evidence**:
- Account_212: "We're already using [Competitor] for monitoring. Easier to add their deploy tool."
- Account_234: "Our team is trained on [Competitor]. Switching cost is high."

**When This Happens**:
- Existing relationship with competitor (e.g., using their monitoring tool)
- Large team (retraining cost matters)
- Multi-year contract (locked in)

**How to Counter**:
- Emphasize integration: "We work alongside [Competitor], not instead of"
- Highlight where we're better: "Their monitoring is great, but deployment is not their core focus"
- Wait for renewal window

**Should We Fight This?**:
- If just renewed (1-2 years left): No, wait for renewal
- If unhappy with competitor: Yes, worth switching cost

## Patterns Over Time

### Q4 2025
- Win rate: 35%
- Top win reason: Time to value (new!)
- Top loss reason: Building in-house

### Q1 2026
- Win rate: 38% (↑3%)
- Top win reason: Time to value (still strong)
- Top loss reason: Competitor preference (new concern)

**Trend Analysis**:
- Time to value messaging is working - keep it
- Competitor comparison content needed (addressing new objection)

---

## How to Use This Data

### For Product Team:
- **Build what helps you win**: Fast onboarding, self-service
- **Address loss reasons**: Comparison tools, competitive feature parity

### For Marketing:
- **Amplify win themes**: Case studies, messaging on "no DevOps team needed"
- **Counter loss themes**: Comparison pages, "buy vs. build" content

### For Sales:
- **Qualify out early**: If they're building in-house and won't budge, disengage
- **Get economic buyer early**: Champion without budget = time wasted
