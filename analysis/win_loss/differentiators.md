# Differentiators (Why We Win)

<!--
PURPOSE: Document what makes you different and better than alternatives.
This is your competitive advantage, backed by evidence from wins.

HOW TO USE:
- Reference in all messaging (website, emails, calls)
- Update as product evolves or competitive landscape changes
- Validate with win/loss analysis (are these actually why we win?)

## Core Differentiators

### 1. Time to Value (Hours, Not Weeks)

**What This Means**:
- Get up and running in <1 hour
- No 2-week implementation project
- No need for professional services

**Why This Matters**:
- Mid-market teams don't have time for long rollouts
- Can trial without massive time investment
- See value immediately

**Evidence from Wins**:
- "Tried it Friday, deployed Monday" - Account_067
- "Other tools quoted 2 weeks to onboard, you were day 1" - Account_023

**Competitive Comparison**:
- Us: 1 hour
- Competitor A: 1-2 weeks
- Competitor B: "Contact sales for implementation"

### 2. Built for Teams Without DevOps Specialists

**What This Means**:
- Self-service, no need for dedicated SRE/DevOps person
- Eng team can use it day 1
- No complex DSLs or configuration

**Why This Matters**:
- Most mid-market companies don't have DevOps teams
- Can't afford $150K+ SRE salary
- Want engineers building product, not internal tools

**Evidence from Wins**:
- "We're 30 engineers, no DevOps person" - Account_089
- "Needed something eng team could self-serve" - Account_102

**Competitive Comparison**:
- Us: Self-service, no specialist needed
- Competitor A: Requires DevOps expertise
- Competitor B: Needs 2-week training

### 3. Pricing Aligns with How You Work

**What This Means**:
- Pay per-project, not per-seat
- Scales with your usage, not team size

**Why This Matters**:
- Per-seat pricing punishes growing teams
- Per-project matches how they think about cost
- Predictable, not exponential growth

**Evidence from Wins**:
- "Per-seat pricing would have been $50K with 50 engineers" - Account_115
- "We have 10 projects, makes sense to pay for those" - Account_134

**Competitive Comparison**:
- Us: Per-project ($X/project/month)
- Competitor A: Per-seat ($Y/seat/month)
- Competitor B: Flat enterprise pricing

## Positioning Against Alternatives

### vs. Building In-House

**When They Consider This**: Larger teams, strong eng culture, have capacity

**Our Advantage**:
- Maintenance burden (who owns this in 2 years?)
- Feature velocity (we ship new features, they maintain legacy)
- Opportunity cost (their engineers should build product, not tools)

**When We Win**: When they value focus over control

---

### vs. Competitor A (Enterprise Tool)

**When They Consider This**: Larger deals, risk-averse buyers

**Our Advantage**:
- Faster time to value (hours vs. weeks)
- Self-service (no implementation team needed)
- Modern UX (they look like 2010)

**When We Win**: When speed and UX matter

---

### vs. Competitor B (Open Source + Managed Service)

**When They Consider This**: Technical teams, budget-conscious

**Our Advantage**:
- Better UX (less config, more automation)
- Support + SLA (they're on their own if it breaks)
- Collaboration features (built in, not bolted on)

**When We Win**: When they value reliability over cost savings

## How Differentiators Evolve

**Track over time**:
- Are new competitors matching our differentiators?
- Are new features creating new differentiators?
- Are old differentiators still resonating in wins?

**Update quarterly** based on:
- Win/loss analysis
- Competitive intel
- Product launches
