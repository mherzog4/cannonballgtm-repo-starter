# Common Objections & Responses

<!--
PURPOSE: Document objections you hear repeatedly and proven responses.
This becomes your objection-handling playbook.

HOW TO USE:
- Train new sales/marketing team members
- Prep before calls (review likely objections)
- Update after discovering new objections or better responses
- Share with product (can features address objections?)
-->

## Format

For each objection:
- **Objection**: What they say
- **Why they say it**: Root concern
- **Response**: How to address it
- **Evidence**: What makes this response credible
- **When it works**: Success rate or scenarios

---

## Objection: "We're already using [Competitor]"

**Why they say it**: Switching cost, existing investment, risk aversion

**Response**:
"Great choice - [Competitor] is strong for [their strength]. Many of our customers use [Competitor] for [X] and us for [Y]. They integrate well.

The main difference: We're built specifically for [your differentiator], whereas [Competitor] is more general-purpose. If [pain point] is your priority, we're purpose-built for that."

**Evidence**: "Account_X also used [Competitor], tried us, and kept both. Here's why..."

**When it works**: 60% success rate if you can position as complementary, not replacement

## Objection: "We're building our own tool"

**Why they say it**: NIH (Not Invented Here) syndrome, have eng capacity, want control

**Response**:
"Totally understand - we see this often with strong eng teams. A few questions:
1. Who's going to maintain this in 2 years when those engineers move on?
2. How will you handle edge cases like [specific technical challenge]?
3. What's the opportunity cost - could those engineers be building your actual product?

We've worked with teams who built in-house first. It works for 6 months, then becomes a maintenance burden. Happy to revisit in Q3 if you want to pilot internally first."

**Evidence**: Share case study of company that regretted building, switched to you

**When it works**: 40% success rate. Often need to let them try and fail first.

## Objection: "This seems expensive"

**Why they say it**: Sticker shock, no painful incident yet, budget constraints

**Response (if budget is real issue)**:
"I hear you. Let's talk about cost differently:
- Your engineers make ~$150K/year = $75/hour
- If this saves 10 hours/week, that's $3,900/month in eng time
- Annual cost of tool: $30K
- Annual value of time saved: $46K
- ROI: Positive in month 1

Plus, one deployment outage can cost $50K-$500K. Think of this as production insurance."

**Response (if objection handling)**:
"Fair question. What would it take to make this a no-brainer? Let's see if we can structure a pilot or phased rollout."

**When it works**: 70% if they have budget but need justification. 20% if budget is truly constrained.

## Objection: "We're too small for this"

**Why they say it**: Think it's for "enterprise", fear it's overkill

**Response**:
"Actually, your size is perfect. Our sweet spot is teams like yours - 10-50 engineers, moving fast, can't dedicate someone to DevOps.

Enterprise tools require a 2-week implementation and a dedicated owner. Ours works day 1, self-service. You're not too small - you're exactly who we built this for."

**Evidence**: "Account_Y is a 15-person team, they went live in 4 hours."

**When it works**: 80% success rate. Usually not a real objection, just positioning misunderstanding.
