# Founder Market Notes - January 2026

<!--
PURPOSE: Capture founder/leadership knowledge about the market that isn't in transcripts.
This is the strategic context that informs everything else.

HOW TO CAPTURE:
1. Record audio note (voice memo on phone)
2. Transcribe (use Whisper, Otter.ai, or similar)
3. Save here with date
4. Reference in campaign briefs and positioning

WHY THIS MATTERS:
Founders have context that's not in data:
- Why we started the company (market insight)
- What customers *really* care about (not what they say)
- Where the market is going
- Competitive dynamics we've observed

## Transcript

_[This is an example. Replace with your actual founder notes.]_

I've been thinking about why we're winning in mid-market fintech lately. It's not actually the product features - everyone has deployment automation now. It's timing.

These companies are at an inflection point. They're 6-12 months post-Series B. They've got money. Their board is asking "why aren't we shipping faster?" and the CTO is stuck between two bad options:

1. Hire a DevOps team (expensive, hard to find good people, takes 6 months)
2. Keep hacking on Jenkins (brittle, doesn't scale, embarrassing)

We're the third option that nobody talks about: Just buy something that works.

But here's what I'm seeing - the companies that buy are the ones where the VP Eng is new. Within their first 90 days, they're looking to make an impact. "I modernized our deployment pipeline" is a quick win they can show.

The ones that don't buy? Either they've got a platform team already (too late for us), or they're pre-pain (20 engineers, manual deploys are annoying but not breaking).

I also think there's a narrative shift happening. 5 years ago, "build vs. buy" was prestigious to build. Now with all the layoffs and "do more with less", buying is smart. Especially for non-differentiating infrastructure.

One more thing: I keep hearing about "deployment Friday freezes". Like it's 2010. These companies are afraid to deploy on Friday because if it breaks, they're working the weekend. That's the pain we solve. They don't want features. They want to go home on Friday.

Oh, and the competitive landscape - [Competitor A] is pivoting to enterprises. They're leaving mid-market. That's our opening. They'll have 6-month sales cycles and we'll have 6-week cycles. We can own this segment.

## Key Insights Extracted

### Insight #1: It's Not About Features, It's About Timing

**What This Means**: Mid-market fintech companies at 6-12 months post-Series B are in the "buying window".

**Why It Matters**: Timing matters more than product fit. Reaching out earlier or later = lower conversion.

**How to Use**: Target companies 6-12 months post-funding, not 0-6 or 12+.

### Insight #2: New VP Eng = Strong Buying Signal

**What This Means**: New VPs want quick wins in first 90 days. Modernizing deployment is a visible win.

**Why It Matters**: Executive changes create buying windows.

**How to Use**: Monitor LinkedIn for new VP Eng/CTO hires, reach out in month 1-3.

### Insight #3: "No Friday Deploys" = Core Pain Point

**What This Means**: They're afraid of breaking production, so they freeze deployments before weekends.

**Why It Matters**: This is emotional pain, not just logical pain. They want to go home on Friday.

**How to Use**: Lead messaging with "Deploy with confidence on Friday" angle.

### Insight #4: Build vs. Buy Narrative Shift

**What This Means**: Post-layoffs, "do more with less" means buying tools is now smart, not lazy.

**Why It Matters**: Removes "we should build this" objection.

**How to Use**: In messaging: "Your engineers should build your product, not reinvent deployment tools."

### Insight #5: Competitor A Leaving Mid-Market

**What This Means**: [Competitor A] is pivoting to enterprise, leaving mid-market underserved.

**Why It Matters**: Market opportunity. We can own this segment.

**How to Use**: Positioning against [Competitor A]: "Built for mid-market, not enterprise."

2. **Add situational trigger**: "New VP Eng in first 90 days"
3. **Update messaging**: Test "No Friday freezes" angle in next campaign
4. **Positioning**: Emphasize mid-market focus vs. [Competitor A]'s enterprise pivot
