# Product Positioning

<!--
PURPOSE: Define how you position your product in the market.
This informs all messaging, campaigns, and conversations.

HOW TO USE:
- Reference when writing campaign messaging
- Use as input to prompt templates in prompts/messaging_generation.md
- Update when market dynamics shift or product evolves

WHAT TO FILL IN:
- Fill in your unique value proposition
- Define competitive alternatives and how you differentiate
- Include the "why now" that makes prospects care
-->

## Core Positioning Statement

**For** _[target customer]_
**Who** _[have this problem/need]_
**Our product** _[product category]_
**That** _[key benefit/value prop]_
**Unlike** _[competitive alternatives]_
**We** _[unique differentiator]_

### Example
**For** engineering teams at fast-growing SaaS companies
**Who** struggle with manual deployment processes and lack of visibility into production
**Our product** is a deployment automation and observability platform
**That** reduces deployment time by 10x and catches issues before customers do
**Unlike** Jenkins + Datadog (separate tools, hard to connect)
**We** provide an integrated solution that's collaborative and requires no DevOps specialist

## Market Category

**Primary Category**: _[Example: Deployment Automation, Developer Tools, Observability]_

**Why This Category**:
- _[Example: Buyers are already searching for solutions in this space]_
- _[Example: We can win against existing alternatives]_
- _[Example: Category is growing 30%+ YoY]_

**Category Alternatives**:
1. _[Example: CI/CD tools (Jenkins, CircleCI, GitHub Actions)]_
2. _[Example: Observability platforms (Datadog, New Relic)]_
3. _[Example: Internal homegrown tools]_
4. _[Example: Manual processes (no tool)]_

## Value Propositions (by Persona)

### For Champions (Engineers/DevOps)
**Top Value Props**:
1. _[Example: "Deploy in 2 minutes instead of 2 hours"]_
2. _[Example: "Catch errors before they reach production"]_
3. _[Example: "No need to learn a new language or DSL"]_

**Why They Care**: _[Example: Reduces toil, lets them focus on building features, makes them look good]_

### For Economic Buyers (VP Eng, CTO)
**Top Value Props**:
1. _[Example: "Reduce infrastructure costs by 40%"]_
2. _[Example: "Ship features 3x faster"]_
3. _[Example: "Avoid costly outages"]_

**Why They Care**: _[Example: Impact on team velocity, cost savings, risk mitigation]_

### For Technical Buyers (Security, Compliance)
**Top Value Props**:
1. _[Example: "SOC 2 compliant, audit logs built-in"]_
2. _[Example: "Role-based access control"]_
3. _[Example: "No third-party data sharing"]_

**Why They Care**: _[Example: Security and compliance requirements must be met]_

## Competitive Positioning

### vs. Alternative 1: _[Example: Jenkins + Manual Scripts]_
**When Prospects Use This**: _[Example: Early-stage teams, legacy setup]_
**Why They Outgrow It**: _[Example: Doesn't scale, brittle, requires dedicated DevOps person]_
**Our Positioning**: _[Example: "Modern alternative that works out of the box, no DevOps team needed"]_

### vs. Alternative 2: _[Example: GitHub Actions]_
**When Prospects Use This**: _[Example: GitHub-native teams, small scale]_
**Why They Outgrow It**: _[Example: Lacks observability, hard to debug, doesn't handle complex workflows]_
**Our Positioning**: _[Example: "Built for scale - GitHub Actions for the build, our platform for deploy + monitor"]_

### vs. Alternative 3: _[Example: Datadog + PagerDuty + Terraform]_
**When Prospects Use This**: _[Example: Mature teams, stitching together best-of-breed]_
**Why They Outgrow It**: _[Example: Tool sprawl, hard to connect the dots, expensive]_
**Our Positioning**: _[Example: "Integrated solution that connects deploy → monitor → alert in one place"]_

### vs. Building In-House
**When Prospects Do This**: _[Example: Large engineering teams, custom requirements]_
**Why They Outgrow It**: _[Example: Maintenance burden, no one wants to work on internal tools, falls behind]_
**Our Positioning**: _[Example: "Focus your engineers on your product, not reinventing deployment tools"]_

## Messaging Framework

### Problem (Agitate the Pain)
_[Example: "Your team spends 10 hours a week deploying code manually. Each deploy is a nail-biter. When something breaks, you're flying blind."]_

### Solution (Introduce Product)
_[Example: "Our platform automates deployments, monitors what's happening, and alerts you before customers notice."]_

### Proof (Social Proof / Results)
_[Example: "Companies like [Customer A] and [Customer B] reduced deploy time by 90% and haven't had an unplanned outage since switching."]_

### Call-to-Action
_[Example: "See it in action in 15 minutes. Book a demo or try it free."]_

## "Why Now" (Situational Triggers)

These are events that make prospects actively look for a solution:

| Trigger | Why It Creates Urgency | Messaging Angle |
|---------|------------------------|-----------------|
| _[Example: Outage caused by bad deploy]_ | _[Pain is acute, exec visibility]_ | _["Avoid the next incident before it happens"]_ |
| _[Example: New VP Eng joins]_ | _[New leader wants quick wins]_ | _["Make an impact in your first 90 days"]_ |
| _[Example: Funding round closed]_ | _[Budget available, growth mode]_ | _["Scale your infra without scaling headcount"]_ |
| _[Example: Hiring DevOps/SRE roles]_ | _[Acknowledging need for better tooling]_ | _["Get started before your first SRE joins"]_ |

See `analysis/situational_changes/hypotheses.md` for full list.

## Objection Handling

### "We already have Jenkins/CircleCI/etc."
**Response**: _[Example: "Great for CI. We complement that by handling CD + observability. You don't replace, you integrate."]_

### "We're too small for this."
**Response**: _[Example: "Perfect time to start. Setting up now means you scale without pain later. Our free tier works for teams under 10."]_

### "We're building our own tool."
**Response**: _[Example: "Totally understand. Most teams we work with tried that first. Eventually the maintenance burden outweighs the benefit. We're here when you're ready."]_

### "This looks expensive."
**Response**: _[Example: "Cost of one outage > annual cost of our platform. Think of it as production insurance."]_

See `analysis/win_loss/objections.md` for full list and responses.

## Positioning Evolution

**How positioning changes over time**:

| Stage | Positioning | Why |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| _[Example: Early (0-10 customers)]_ | _["The modern deployment tool engineers love"]_ | _[Focus on product quality, early adopter appeal]_ |
| _[Example: Growth (10-100 customers)]_ | _["Deployment automation for fast-growing teams"]_ | _[Expand to broader market, emphasize growth]_ |
| _[Example: Scale (100+ customers)]_ | _["The deployment platform for modern engineering teams"]_ | _[Category leadership, trusted by many]_ |

**Current Stage**: _[Example: Early/Growth/Scale]_

**When to evolve**:
- After hitting next customer milestone
- When competitive landscape shifts
- When product capabilities expand into new category
