# Persona Definitions (YAML Format)
#
# PURPOSE: Machine-readable persona data for use in pipelines and AI agents.
# This complements persona_taxonomy.md with structured data.
#
# HOW TO USE:
# - Load in Python/analysis scripts for persona-based filtering
# - Reference in prompt templates for messaging generation
# - Use in campaigns/*/personas.yaml to specify target personas
#
# WHAT TO FILL IN:
# - Replace example values with your actual persona data
# - Keep consistent with persona_taxonomy.md
# - Add/remove personas as your buying committee evolves
