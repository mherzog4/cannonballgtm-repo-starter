## Decision Log

### Decision #1: Target Only Series B/C (Not Series A)

**Date**: 2026-01-15
**Decision**: Filter to Series B and C funding rounds, exclude Series A
**Rationale**:
- Series A companies are often too early (still <50 employees)
- Our sweet spot is 200-1,000 employees
- Series B/C have more budget ($10M+ raises)
- Historical win rate: 45% for B/C vs. 25% for Series A

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Include Series A: Decided against (too early stage, low win rate)
- Include Series D+: Decided against (getting too enterprise, longer sales cycle)

**Owner**: [Name]

### Decision #2: Lead with VP Eng (Not Eng Manager)

**Date**: 2026-01-15
**Decision**: Primary outreach to VP Engineering, secondary to Eng Manager
**Rationale**:
- VP Eng has budget authority
- Post-funding, executives feel pressure from board
- Can shorten sales cycle (decision-maker involved early)
- Past campaigns: 60% of deals had VP Eng involved from first call

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Lead with Eng Manager: Decided against (need exec buy-in for budget, takes longer)
- Multi-thread (both at once): Too aggressive for cold outreach

**Owner**: [Name]

### Decision #3: 3-Email Sequence Over 2 Weeks

**Date**: 2026-01-15
**Decision**: 3 emails spaced 5 days apart, not longer sequence
**Rationale**:
- Our response rate drops significantly after email 3
- Don't want to burn relationship with too many emails
- If no response after 3, move to LinkedIn or phone

**Alternatives Considered**:
- 5-email sequence: Decided against (diminishing returns, risk of spam)
- 2-email sequence: Decided against (not enough touchpoints)

**Owner**: [Name]

### Decision #4: Use Account_023 as Primary Social Proof

**Date**: 2026-01-15
**Decision**: Lead social proof with Account_023 story (Series B fintech, 350 employees)
**Rationale**:
- Perfect ICP match (post-Series B fintech, similar size)
- Strong outcome ($50K ARR, 90% time savings)
- Champion quote is compelling

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Use Account_041: Also good but larger (650 employees), less relatable
- Use multiple examples: Decided against (too wordy for email)

**Owner**: [Name]
